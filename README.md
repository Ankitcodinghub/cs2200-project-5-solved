‚Ä¢ The LC-900 assembler is written in Python. If you do not have Python 2.6 or newer installed on your system, you will need to install it before you continue.

2 Project Overview and Description

Project 1 is designed to give you a good feel for exactly how a processor works. In Phase 1, you will design a datapath in CircuitSim to implement a supplied instruction set architecture. You will use the datapath as a tool to determine the control signals needed to execute each instruction. In Phases 2 and 3, you are required to build a simple finite state machine (the ‚Äúcontrol unit‚Äù) to control your computer and actually run programs on it.

Note: You will need to have a working knowledge of CircuitSim. Make sure that you know how to make basic circuits as well as subcircuits before proceeding. The TAs are always here if you need help.

3 Phase 1 ‚Äì Implement the Datapath

Figure 1: Datapath for the LC-900 Processor

In this phase of the project, you must learn the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for the processor we will be implementing. Afterwards, we will implement a complete LC-900 datapath in CircuitSim using what you have just learned.

You must do the following:

1. Learn and understand the LC-900 ISA. The ISA is fully specified and defined in Appendix A: LC-900

Instruction Set Architecture. Do not move on until you have fully read and understood the ISA specification. Every single detail will be relevant to implementing your datapath in the next step.

2. Using CircuitSim, implement the LC-900 datapath. To do this, you will need to use the details of the LC-900 datapath defined in Appendix A: LC-900 Instruction Set Architecture. You should model your datapath on Figure 1.

3.1 Hints

3.1.1 Subcircuits

CircuitSim enables you to break create reusable components in the form of subcircuits. We highly recommend that you break parts of your design up into subcircuits. At a minimum, you will want to implement your ALU in a subcircuit. The control unit you implement in Phase 2 is another prime candidate for a subcircuit.

3.1.2 Debugging

As you build the datapath, you should consider adding functionality that will allow you to operate the whole datapath by hand. This will make testing individual operations quite simple. We suggest your datapath include devices that will allow you to put arbitrary values on the bus and to view the current value of the bus. Feel free to add any additional hardware that will help you understand what is going on.

3.1.3 Memory Addresses

Because of CircuitSim limitations, the RAM module is limited to no more than 16 address bits. Therefore, per our ISA, any 32-bit values used as memory addresses will be truncated to 16 bits (with the 16 most significant bits disregarded). We would like you to implement this (i.e. truncate the most significant bits) before feeding the address value from the MAR (Memory Address Register) to the RAM.

3.1.4 Comparison Logic

The ‚Äúcomparison logic‚Äù box in Figure 1 is responsible for performing the comparison logic associated with the SKP instructions. The comparison logic should read the current value on the bus plus the mode bits (CmpSel) from the IR. When executing the SKP instructions, you should compute A‚àíB using the ALU. While this result of the ALU is being driven on the bus, the comparison logic should read the result A‚àíB and output a single ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse‚Äù bit for the selected condition (CmpSel).

Your comparison logic should be purely combinational. Feel free to use any CircuitSim components you wish to aid in your implementation. Note that the three outputs of a comparator are gt, eq, lt which correspond to bits 2, 1, and 0 in the SKP instruction. Also note that bits 0:2 can be obtained from the value chosen by RegSel.

3.1.5 Register File

3.1.6 Register Select

From lecture and the textbook, you should be familiar with the ‚Äúregister select‚Äù (RegSel) multiplexer. The mux is responsible for feeding the register number from the correct field in the instruction into the register file. See Table 4 for a list of inputs your mux should have.

4 Phase 2 ‚Äì Implement the Microcontrol Unit

In this phase of the project, you will use CircuitSim to implement the microcontrol unit for the LC-900 processor. This component is referred to as the ‚ÄúControl Logic‚Äù in the images and schematics. The microcontroller will contain all of the signal lines to the various parts of the datapath.

You must do the following:

1. Read and understand the microcontroller logic:

‚Ä¢ Please refer to Appendix B: Microcontrol Unit for details.

‚Ä¢ Note: You will be required to generate the control signals for each state of the processor in the next phase, so make sure you understand the connections between the datapath and the microcontrol unit before moving on.

2. Implement the Microcontrol Unit using CircuitSim. The appendix contains all of the necessary information. Take note that the input and output signals on the schematics directly match the signals marked in the LC-900 datapath schematic (see Figure 1).

5 Phase 3 ‚Äì Microcode and Testing

In this final stage of the project, you will write the microcode control program that will be loaded into the microcontrol unit you implemented in Phase 2. Then, you will hook up the control unit you built in Phase 2 of the project to the datapath you implemented in Phase 1. Finally, you will test your completed computer using a simple test program and ensure that it properly executes.

You must do the following:

1. Open and fill out microcode.xlsx file we‚Äôve provided you (note: the formulas in the provided file will only work with Excel). You will need to mark which control signal is high (that is 1) for each of the states.

2. After you have completed all the microstates, convert the binary strings you just computed into hex and move them into the main ROM. You can just copy and paste the hex column (highlighted yellow) from the spreadsheet directly into the ROM component in Circuitsim. Do the same for the sequencer and condition ROMs.

3. Connect the completed control unit to the datapath you implemented in Phase 1. Using Figures 1 and 2, connect the control signals to their appropriate spots.

4. Finally, it is time to test your completed computer. Use the provided assembler (found in the ‚Äúassembly‚Äù folder) to convert a test program from assembly to hex. For instructions on how to use the assembler and simulator, see README.txt in the ‚Äúassembly‚Äù folder. Note: The simulator does not test your project, it simply provides a model. To test your design, you must load the assembled HEX into CircuitSim. We recommend using test programs that contain a single instruction since you are bound to have a few bugs at this stage of the project. Once you have built confidence, test your processor with the provided pow.s program as a more comprehensive test case.

7 Appendix A: LC-900 Instruction Set Architecture

The LC-900 is a simple, yet capable computer architecture. The LC-900 combines attributes of both ARM and the LC-2200 ISA defined in the Ramachandran &amp; Leahy textbook for CS 2200.

The LC-900 is a word-addressable, 32-bit computer. All addresses refer to words, i.e. the first word (four bytes) in memory occupies address 0x0, the second word, 0x1, etc.

All memory addresses are truncated to 16 bits on access, discarding the 16 most significant bits if the address was stored in a 32-bit register. This provides roughly 64 KB of addressable memory.

7.1 Registers

The LC-900 has 16 general-purpose registers. While there are no hardware-enforced restraints on the uses of these registers, your code is expected to follow the conventions outlined below.

Table 1: Registers and their Uses

Register Number Name Use Callee Save?

0 $zero Always Zero NA

1 $at Assembler/Target Address NA

2 $v0 Return Value No

3 $a0 Argument 1 No

4 $a1 Argument 2 No

5 $a2 Argument 3 No

6 $t0 Temporary Variable No

7 $t1 Temporary Variable No

8 $t2 Temporary Variable No

9 $s0 Saved Register Yes

10 $s1 Saved Register Yes

11 $s2 Saved Register Yes

12 $k0 Reserved for OS and Traps NA

13 $sp Stack Pointer No

14 $fp Frame Pointer Yes

15 $ra Return Address No

1. Register 0 is always read as zero. Any values written to it are discarded. Note: for the purposes of this project, you must implement the zero register. Regardless of what is written to this register, it should always output zero.

3. Register 2 is where you should store any returned value from a subroutine call.

4. Registers 3 ‚Äì 5 are used to store function/subroutine arguments. Note: registers 2 through 8 should be placed on the stack if the caller wants to retain those values. These registers are fair game for the callee (subroutine) to trash.

5. Registers 6 ‚Äì 8 are designated for temporary variables. The caller must save these registers if they want these values to be retained.

7. Register 12 is reserved for handling interrupts. While it should be implemented, it otherwise will not have any special use on this assignment.

8. Register 13 is your anchor on the stack. It keeps track of the top of the activation record for a subroutine.

9. Register 14 is used to point to the first address on the activation record for the currently executing process.

10. Register 15 is used to store the address a subroutine should return to when it is finished executing.

7.2.1 Conditional Branching

Branching in the LC-900 ISA is a bit different than usual. We have one branch instruction: the BR instruction, which, if executed, unconditionally jumps/changes the PC. Then, we have a series of instructions known as the skip-instructions, or SKP instructions. These instructions use the comparison operators, comparing the values of two source registers. If the comparisons are true (for example, with the SKPGT instruction, if SR1 &gt; SR2), then we skip over the next line of code ‚Äì we increment PC by 1 (remember that at the time of execution, PC has already been incremented by 1, so this is an additional increment).

These SKP instructions all have the same opcode and use bits 2:0 to determine the comparison type (CmpSel). Bit 0 controls less then, bit 1 controls equals, and bit 2 controls greater than. For example, if you wanted to do a SKPGE (skip greater than or equal), you would set the CmpSel bits as: 110 (high for greater than and high for equals.)

Branching can then be accomplished by using the SKP instructions to do comparison-checking, and using BR instructions below those SKP instructions. Particular BR instructions are taken if a particular comparison result is reached.

8 Appendix B: Microcontrol Unit

You will make a microcontrol unit which will drive all of the control signals to various items on the datapath. This Finite State Machine (FSM) can be constructed in a variety of ways. You could implement it with combinational logic and flip flops, or you could hard-wire signals using a single ROM. The single ROM solution will waste a tremendous amount of space since most of the microstates do not depend on the opcode or the conditional test to determine which signals to assert. For example, since the condition line is an input for the address, every microstate would have to have an address for condition = 0 as well as condition = 1, even though this only matters for one particular microstate.

To solve this problem, we will use a three ROM microcontroller. In this arrangement, we will have three ROMs:

‚Ä¢ the main ROM, which outputs the control signals,

‚Ä¢ the sequencer ROM, which helps to determine which microstate to go at the end of the FETCH state,

‚Ä¢ and the condition ROM, which helps determine whether or not to skip during the SKP instructions.

Examine the following:

Figure 2: Three ROM Microcontrol Unit

As you can see, there are three different locations that the next state can come from: part of the output from the previous state (main ROM), the sequencer ROM, and the condition ROM. The mux controls which of these sources gets through to the state register. If the previous state‚Äôs ‚Äúnext state‚Äù field determines where to go, neither the OPTest nor ChkCmp signals will be asserted. If the opcode from the IR determines the next state (such as at the end of the FETCH state), the OPTest signal will be asserted. If the comparison circuitry determines the next state (such as in the SKP instruction), the ChkCmp signal will be asserted. Note that these two signals should never be asserted at the same time since nothing is input into the ‚Äú11‚Äù pin on the MUX.

The sequencer ROM should have one address per instruction, and the condition ROM should have one address for condition true and one for condition false.

Before getting down to specifics you need to determine the control scheme for the datapath. To do this examine each instruction, one by one, and construct a finite state bubble diagram showing exactly what control signals will be set in each state. Also determine what are the conditions necessary to pass from one state to the next. You can experiment by manually controlling your control signals on the bus you‚Äôve created in Phase 1 ‚Äì Implement the Datapath to make sure that your logic is sound.

Once the finite state bubble diagram is produced, the next step is to encode the contents of the Control Unit ROM using the provided microcode spreadsheet (microcode/microcode.xlsx). Then you must design and build (in CircuitSim) the Control Unit circuit which will contain the three ROMs, a MUX, and a state register. Your design will be better if it allows you to single step and ensure that it is working properly. Finally, you will load the Control Unit‚Äôs ROMs with the hexadecimal generated by the yellow highlighted columns in the spreadsheet. You can simply drag to select all yellow highlighted columns, copy, and then right click the ROM in CircuitSim ‚Üí edit contents ‚Üí paste in upper left cell.

Note that the input address to the ROM uses bit 0 for the lowest bit of the current state and 5 for the highest bit for the current state.
